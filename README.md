# VSD-Design-and-Synthesis
RTL Design and Synthesis using SKY130 Technology

About the Workshop

This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on exercises, Verilog designs, synthesis outputs, and simulation results from the RTL Design and Synthesis using SKY130 Technology Workshop conducted by VLSI System Design (VSD).

The workshop provided practical exposure to RTL design using Verilog, simulation using open-source EDA tools, synthesis using Yosys, and analysis of synthesized netlists using the SKY130 standard cell library.

Tools Used

* iVerilog – Open-source Verilog compiler and simulator
* GTKWave – Waveform viewer for simulation analysis
* Yosys – Open-source synthesis suite
* SKY130 Standard Cell Library – Open-source PDK library for synthesis
